Welcome to instaSpy! Here, you will find an exciting Python script that utilizes the power of Selenium to scrape usernames of your Instagram followers and following. But that's not all â€“ this script goes a step further by identifying the users who have unfollowed you on Instagram.

Tracking followers and unfollowers can be a time-consuming task, especially when dealing with a large number of users. That's where this script comes in handy, automating the process and providing you with valuable insights about your Instagram audience.

By leveraging Selenium, a powerful web automation tool, this script navigates through Instagram's interface, interacts with the elements, and extracts the usernames of your followers and following. It then cleverly compares the lists to determine who has recently unfollowed you.

I have designed this script with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and readability. Each step is thoroughly documented, making it easy for you to understand and customize the code to suit your specific needs. Additionally, I have included comprehensive instructions on how to set up and run the script successfully.

Whether you're an Instagram influencer, a social media enthusiast, or simply curious about tracking your followers, this Python script will be a valuable addition to your toolkit. So, go ahead and explore this repository to take control of your Instagram audience and stay informed about those who choose to unfollow you.
